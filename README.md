# Hub-and-Spoke-Logistics-Network-Considering-Pricing-and-Co-Opetition
With the rapid development of the logistics market, the construction of an efficient “channel
+ hub + network” logistics system, that is, a hub-and-spoke logistics network, is of great importance
to enterprises. In particular, how to reduce costs and increase efficiency in both the construction
of network facilities and actual operations, and to formulate reasonable prices for the logistics
service needs in the entire market are crucial strategies and decisions for enterprises. Under such
a background, this article starts from the perspective of duopoly logistics enterprises that jointly
build networks and allow the transfer of surplus capacity and carbon credits, and studies the huband-
spoke logistics network design that also considers the relationship between service pricing
and co-opetition. Considering the corporate profit and difficulty of implementation as a whole, the
co-opetition is a better choice than the complete competition and perfect cooperation. In addition,
the remaining capacity of the company, the transfer of carbon credits, the joint construction and
sharing of hubs, and strategic cooperation in the area of corporate common pricing under the price
framework agreement are conducive to the realization of an increase in corporate operating profits, a
better market share and more favorable pricing.
